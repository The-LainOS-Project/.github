### LainOS currently features a Calamares installer, two lightweight default window managers; Hyprland and Openbox respectively, personalized eyecatching yet functional visual aesthetics which blend function and form together without compromise, Easter eggs for wired people, and an efficient tool selection all tailored to the SEL community in a creative manner we hope they appreciate as much as we do.
