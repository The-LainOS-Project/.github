# Welcome to LainOS. We have moved the project to GitLab: https://gitlab.com/lainos
LainOS is a community driven Linux project lead by Grayson Giles (@amnesia1337) and built by several developers from the global Serial Experiments Lain community who came together and decided it was time to do something about the execution of the LainOS concept and now project, originally derived from the 2002 LainOS.org coding experiments project, starting in early 2022.
This project aims to create a light, useful and powerful linux distribution based on Arch Linux aimed at developers, tinkerers, and hackers alike who share the admiration of Serial Experiments Lain and similar works. If you like what we are doing, consider donating to our liberapay. https://liberapay.com/LainOS/

### LainOS currently features a Calamares installer, two lightweight default window managers; Hyprland and Openbox respectively, personalized eyecatching yet functional visual aesthetics which blend function and form together without compromise, Easter eggs for wired people, and an efficient tool selection all tailored to the SEL community in a creative manner we hope they appreciate as much as we do.
